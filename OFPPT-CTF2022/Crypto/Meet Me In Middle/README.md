# Meet Me In Middle 
#####  A company has deployed their own cryptographic service. They challenged anyone to break it even if they have shared the source code. The keys are unknown to everyone but them.
##### Fortunately, their encryption algorithm is vulnerable. Could you help us break the encryption and read their secret flag? 

We have the following encrypted text:
```
Super strong encryption service approved by 2022 stansdards.
Message to decrypt:
187f25ea856f518bcd8e7e7c17e7e6016bc77459513740e6792c84d07b465ea9cee6609881421eb4ae1606792a2d8859
Encrypt your text:
>
{"pt":"4f465050542d435446"}
f71f3b195e2336a6d30077b8184304c6
```
And the following code:
```python
from random import randint
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad
import json

flag = b'OFPPT-CTF{Not_the_real_flag}'

def gen_key(option=0):
    alphabet = b'0123456789abcdef'
    const = b'0fpptCTF5!@#'
    key = b''
    for i in range(16-len(const)):
        key += bytes([alphabet[randint(0,15)]])

    if option:
        return key + const
    else:
        return const + key

def encrypt(data, key1, key2):
    cipher = AES.new(key1, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    ct = cipher.encrypt(pad(data, 16))
    cipher = AES.new(key2, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    ct = cipher.encrypt(ct)
    return ct.hex()


def challenge():
    k1 = gen_key()
    k2 = gen_key(1)

    
    ct = encrypt(flag, k1, k2)
    
    
    print('Super strong encryption service approved by 2022 stansdards.\n'+\
                    'Message to decrypt:\n' +ct + '\nEncrypt your text:\n> ')
    try:
            
        dt = json.loads(input().strip())
        pt = bytes.fromhex(dt['pt'])
        res = encrypt(pt, k1, k2)
        print(res + '\n')
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        print('Invalid payload.\n')
        exit(1)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    challenge()
```
As we can see, the flag is encrypted twice with **AES-ECB** with two different keys, and after that the program asks us to input a plaintext and then ecrypts it with the same two keys.

The key generation is weak due to it having only 4 random characters and we know the alphabet

This is a **Meet in the middle attack** and the problem is almost the exact same as the one in this [writeup](https://int80h.netlify.app/writeup/byte-bandits-2020-meet-me-there/).

What we need to do the is the following:
* Encrypt the plain text we are given with all the possible key1 and save all the ciphertexts with their respective keys.
* Decrypt the ciphertext we are given with all the possible key2.
* If we find a coincidence it means we found both keys.
